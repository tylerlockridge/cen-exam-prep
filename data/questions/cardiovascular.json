      "rationale": "This patient is experiencing an inferior wall STEMI (ST elevation in II, III, aVF indicates right coronary artery occlusion). The priority is to activate the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Door-to-balloon time goal is <90 minutes. While aspirin is important and should be given, cath lab activation takes priority. Nitroglycerin is relatively contraindicated with hypotension (BP 90/60) and inferior MI (risk of right ventricular involvement). Biomarkers should not delay reperfusion therapy.",

Key findings include: atypical presentation common in diabetics and women (fatigue, nausea, epigastric discomfort rather than classic chest pain), ST depression and T-wave inversions (ischemic changes without ST elevation), and elevated troponin indicating myocardial necrosis. STEMI requires ST elevation. Stable angina does not cause troponin elevation. Pericarditis typically shows diffuse ST elevation and PR depression.",

Unlike STEMI, pericarditis causes diffuse (widespread) ST elevation that does not follow a coronary artery distribution, along with PR segment depression (especially in lead II) and PR elevation in aVR. Contiguous ST elevation suggests STEMI. Q waves indicate prior infarction. T-wave inversions are nonspecific and can occur in many conditions.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "rationale": "According to ACLS guidelines, immediately after delivering a defibrillation shock, CPR should be resumed for 2 minutes (5 cycles) before rechecking rhythm. This allows time for the heart to recover and potentially establish perfusion. Checking pulse immediately after shock wastes valuable time. Epinephrine is given after the second shock (during CPR). Stacked shocks are no longer recommended; single shocks followed by immediate CPR is the current standard.",

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation reduces preload, decreases work of breathing, improves oxygenation, and can prevent intubation. The patient's SpO2 of 82% indicates severe hypoxemia requiring immediate respiratory support. Furosemide is important but takes time to work.

This patient demonstrates hemodynamic instability (hypotension BP 78/50, altered mental status) requiring immediate intervention. Electrical cardioversion is faster and more reliable than pharmacological approaches in unstable patients. Diltiazem and amiodarone are appropriate for stable patients.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "rationale": "A sudden, sustained increase in ETCO2 during CPR strongly suggests return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). When the heart resumes effective pumping, CO2 that accumulated in tissues during arrest is delivered to the lungs and exhaled, causing ETCO2 to rise dramatically. ETCO2 <10 mmHg during CPR suggests poor perfusion. Tube displacement would cause ETCO2 to drop. Hyperventilation decreases ETCO2. This is why continuous waveform capnography is recommended during resuscitation.",

Other signs include pulsus paradoxus (>10 mmHg drop in SBP during inspiration) and electrical alternans on ECG. The first option describes Cushing's triad (increased ICP).

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "rationale": "Primary PCI should not be delayed for STEMI patients on anticoagulation. Radial artery access is preferred over femoral access in anticoagulated patients because it has lower bleeding complications and allows easier hemostasis with compression. Studies show radial access reduces major bleeding and mortality. Delaying reperfusion increases myocardial damage. Reversing anticoagulation takes time and delays treatment. Thrombolytics are contraindicated with elevated INR due to bleeding risk.",

Adenosine causes transient AV nodal block, interrupting the reentrant circuit. It must be given rapidly through a large proximal vein followed by a 20mL saline flush due to its 6-second half-life.

The initial IV dose should be at least equivalent to the patient's total daily oral dose. This patient shows clear volume overload (weight gain, edema, elevated BNP).

This patient has third-degree (complete) heart block with hemodynamic instability (hypotension, dizziness). Atropine is often ineffective in complete heart block because the block is below the AV node. Maximum atropine dose is 3mg; additional doses are unlikely to help.

Synchronization is not used because: 1) there is no pulse (patient is in cardiac arrest), and 2) the synchronization function may delay shock delivery if the monitor cannot identify R waves in rapid VT.

      "rationale": "AV nodal blocking agents (diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin, adenosine) are CONTRAINDICATED in WPW with atrial fibrillation. In WPW, an accessory pathway bypasses the AV node. Blocking the AV node forces all conduction through the accessory pathway, which can conduct rapidly and degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Treatment options include procainamide (slows accessory pathway conduction), ibutilide, or synchronized cardioversion if unstable. Amiodarone is controversial - it has some AV nodal blocking properties but also slows accessory pathway; procainamide is preferred. Definitive treatment is catheter ablation.",

      "rationale": "Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) can occur acutely (within days of IV loading) or chronically (months to years of oral therapy). Acute presentation includes dyspnea, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Risk factors include high cumulative dose, pre-existing lung disease, and high FiO2 exposure. Mechanism involves direct toxicity and immune-mediated injury. Treatment requires stopping amiodarone and often corticosteroids. AIPT has significant mortality. Other amiodarone toxicities include thyroid dysfunction, hepatotoxicity, corneal deposits, and skin photosensitivity. The long half-life (40-55 days) means effects persist after discontinuation.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "rationale": "This patient has cardiogenic shock with relative hypovolemia (low PCWP of 8 mmHg). Classic cardiogenic shock has elevated filling pressures (PCWP >18), but this patient's low PCWP suggests inadequate preload despite pump failure. This can occur with RV infarction, excessive diuresis, or inadequate fluid intake. Treatment requires careful fluid administration to optimize preload while supporting the failing heart. Typical cardiogenic shock (high PCWP) is treated with inotropes and diuretics. Low CI (<2.2) with low PCWP needs volume. Distributive shock has low SVR. Obstructive shock has mechanical obstruction (PE, tamponade).",

      "rationale": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes in the United States. HCM causes asymmetric septal hypertrophy that can obstruct left ventricular outflow and predispose to fatal arrhythmias during exertion. Other causes include anomalous coronary arteries, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), commotio cordis, and channelopathies (Long QT, Brugada). Pre-participation screening with history, physical exam, and sometimes ECG aims to identify at-risk athletes. In older athletes (>35), coronary artery disease becomes the leading cause.",
