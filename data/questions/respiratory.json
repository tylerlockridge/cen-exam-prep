      "rationale": "IV magnesium sulfate (2g over 20 minutes) is indicated for severe asthma exacerbations not responding adequately to initial bronchodilator therapy. This patient has severe/life-threatening asthma: unable to speak full sentences, SpO2 <90%, peak flow <50% predicted. Magnesium causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. While corticosteroids are essential, IV/oral steroids take 4-6 hours for effect. Magnesium provides faster bronchodilation. Chest X-ray should not delay treatment. Continuous nebulized albuterol, ipratropium, and systemic steroids should also be given.",

In pure acute respiratory acidosis, HCO3 rises only 1 mEq/L per 10 mmHg PaCO2 increase. This patient's HCO3 of 32 suggests chronic compensation (3-4 mEq/L per 10 mmHg in chronic).

The triad of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis is highly suggestive. Post-operative immobility increases DVT risk. Hypotension suggests massive PE with hemodynamic compromise. Immediate evaluation with CT pulmonary angiography (or bedside echo if unstable) and anticoagulation are indicated. MI typically causes pressure-like chest pain.

Insert a large-bore needle (14-16 gauge) at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line on the affected side (right side - opposite to tracheal deviation). Tracheal deviation occurs AWAY from the tension. A rush of air confirms the diagnosis. Follow with chest tube placement. Tension pneumothorax causes cardiovascular collapse due to mediastinal shift and impaired venous return. Delaying treatment for imaging can be fatal.

This patient shows signs of impending respiratory failure: accessory muscle use, paradoxical breathing (diaphragmatic fatigue), severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 78), and acidosis (pH 7.25). BiPAP reduces work of breathing, improves ventilation, and can prevent intubation. Typical settings: IPAP 10-12, EPAP 4-5, titrate to comfort and ABG improvement.

      "rationale": "A 'silent chest' (diminished breath sounds with decreased wheezing) in a patient with severe asthma who becomes drowsy indicates impending respiratory failure. Wheezing requires airflow - as airways become critically obstructed, airflow decreases and wheezing diminishes. Combined with altered mental status (CO2 narcosis from hypercapnia), this is a pre-arrest situation requiring immediate intervention: prepare for intubation, continue aggressive bronchodilator therapy, consider IV epinephrine or terbutaline. Improvement would show increased air movement and clearing wheezes with improved mental status. This is NOT a good sign.",

      "rationale": "This patient has acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (flash pulmonary edema) with severe hypertension. Priority is BiPAP (reduces preload, decreases work of breathing, improves oxygenation) and nitroglycerin (reduces preload and afterload, decreases pulmonary congestion). Pink frothy sputum is classic for pulmonary edema. BiPAP can prevent intubation in many cases. Nitroglycerin IV infusion is preferred for rapid titration. Furosemide is important but takes time to work and may cause reflex vasoconstriction initially. Diagnostic studies should not delay treatment.

This patient has massive PE: hypotension (SBP <90), tachycardia, hypoxemia, and RV strain on imaging. Thrombolytics rapidly dissolve clot and reduce RV afterload. Contraindications must be considered but hemodynamic collapse often outweighs bleeding risk. Heparin alone is insufficient for massive PE.

This patient fits the classic profile: young, tall, thin male (due to apical blebs). No intervention is needed if the patient remains stable and pneumothorax doesn't expand. High-flow oxygen can increase reabsorption rate from 1.25% to 4% per day.

      "rationale": "The patient is showing improvement (PaCO2 decreased from 72 to 65, pH improving) but still has significant hypercapnia. Increasing IPAP (inspiratory pressure) will increase tidal volume and minute ventilation, further reducing PaCO2. The pressure support (IPAP minus EPAP) drives ventilation. Typical IPAP range is 10-20 cm H2O. Address mask discomfort by adjusting fit, trying different mask types, or using skin barriers. Decreasing IPAP would reduce ventilation. CPAP provides no pressure support for ventilation. Intubation is premature given the patient is improving. Continue to titrate BiPAP based on clinical response and ABGs.",

Ketamine causes catecholamine release and direct smooth muscle relaxation, leading to bronchodilation. It also maintains respiratory drive and hemodynamic stability. Dose: 1-2 mg/kg IV. Etomidate is hemodynamically neutral but has no bronchodilatory effect. Propofol can cause hypotension and histamine release (theoretical concern). Midazolam provides no bronchodilation.

      "rationale": "This patient is in the Yellow Zone. Peak flow of 225 L/min is 45% of personal best (225/500 = 0.45 = 45%), which actually falls in the Red Zone (<50%). Let me recalculate: 225/500 = 45%, which is <50%, placing the patient in the RED ZONE. Red zone (<50% personal best) indicates severe exacerbation requiring immediate bronchodilator use and emergency care if no improvement. Yellow zone (50-80%) indicates caution - increase medications per action plan. Green zone (>80%) indicates good control. Peak flow monitoring helps patients recognize deterioration before severe symptoms develop. This patient needs immediate treatment and likely ED evaluation.",
